Everyone can see them for what they are, at the dinner table. Come on ladies make some food movies!!!

Women Prefer Knives

She was standing alone, all alone. She knew no one but her kitchen tools. She knows her kitchen tools really well.

She silently sets up her table for two.

She sets out her biggest knife at the other placement on the table.

Knives are so sexy.

It just sits there on the table waiting to be handled.

And mishandled.

A knock at the door. Nobody's home.

A chime in the kitchen. And, she's licking someone's boots. White boots. Black laces. Nazi boots.

In her mind, she's somewhere else. She glances off to the binary and she notices something. Lurking in the quantum. Nothing.

She notices nothing.

Then nothing moves into place.

The knife flies off the table and it startles her.
